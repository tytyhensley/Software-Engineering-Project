for our project we were initially going to use a combination of JS, HTML and CSS. We changed our mind later in the course, however. We decided to learn 
a new technology, Flutter, and develop our app entirely using its language Dart. We decided to use only Dart for the project development because it's a
very powerful language and has flexcibilities and abilities of scripting languages like Python and compiled languages like Java. Since this is the only 
language we will be using, there is going to be only one language in our calculations for the FPA. One problem that we faced while updating our FPA
calculations was our uncertainty about the Language Factor (LF) for Dart. The language did not seem to have a present LF in the common tables available in 
the internet. After consulting with our TA for the class we decided to use the LF from a comparable language. Dart is similar to C# and Java in syntax and 
have a lot of other similarities e.g itâ€™s a compiled, type-safe language just like C# and Java. Based on the team's judgement, we identified Java to be the 
most similar to Dart and used it as a base in our calculations.
